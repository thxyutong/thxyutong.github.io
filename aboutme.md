I am a senior undergraduate student majoring in **Computer Science** at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](http://en.sjtu.edu.cn/) as a member of [ACM Honors Class](https://acm.sjtu.edu.cn/home), [Zhiyuan College](https://zhiyuan.sjtu.edu.cn)，which is an elite CS program at SJTU for top 5% talented students.

Currently I'm a visiting student at UMich, working with [Prof. Qiaozhu Mei](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~qmei/).

I plan to apply for Ph.D. programs in Computer Science that start in Fall 2020, and here is my [curriculum vitae](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yutxie/yutxie.github.io/master/files/Yutong%20Xie.pdf).
