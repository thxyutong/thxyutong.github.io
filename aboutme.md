> The highest activity a human being can attain is learning for understanding, because to understand is to be free. -- Baruch Spinoza

---------------------------- 

# Education

*I'm planning to apply for Ph.D. programs in Computer Science which start in Fall 2020.*

[**Shanghai Jiao Tong University**](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/), *Sep. 2016 - Jun. 2020 (expected)*

- B.Sc. in Computer Science.
- Member of [**ACM Class**](https://acm.sjtu.edu.cn/), an elite CS program for top 5% talented students.
- Member of [**Zhiyuan Honors Program**](https://zhiyuan.sjtu.edu.cn/), a pilot program for training outstand-ing students in the basic sciences.
- Major GPA 91.67/100.

# Research Interests

My reserch interests lie in structural representation learning, e.g. **graph representation learning**, **natural language understanding**; and I’m also attracted by general machine learning problems, e.g. **multi-task learning**, **transfer learning**, **model capacity and generalization ability**.


# Research Experience

[**Foreseer Group**](http://foreseer.si.umich.edu/), iSchool, University of Michigan, *Jun. 2019 -- Present*

- Research intern advised by [Prof. Qiaozhu Mei](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~qmei/).
- Researching on graph representation learning and multi-task learning.

[**Apex Data & Knowledge Management Lab**](http://apex.sjtu.edu.cn), SJTU, *Jun. 2018 -- Present*

- Research intern advised by [Prof. Yong Yu](http://apex.sjtu.edu.cn/members/yyu), and [Prof. Weinan Zhang](http://wnzhang.net/)
- Researching on code comprehension and  natural language processing.

# Research Projects

Code Comprehension Graph for Algorithm Detection from Source Code
- **Y. Xie** *, T. Long*, X. Chen, H. Zhao, W. Zhang, Q. Cao, Y. Yu
- Submitted to AAAI 2020. 
- Aimed at identifying algorithms in programs.
- Proposed an effective program representation named code comprehension graph that consists of three subgraphs (data ﬂow graph, control ﬂow graph and abstract syntax tree) to capture both syntactic and semantic information.


Visual Rhythm Prediction with Feature-Aligned Network
- **Y. Xie**, H. Wang, Y. Hao, Z. Xu
- Proceedings of [the 16th IAPR International Conference on Machine Vision Applications Conference (MVA 2019)](http://www.mva-org.jp/Proceedings/2019/).
- Course project of [Computer Vision](http://www.mvig.org/teaching/index.html), advised by [Prof. Cewu Lu](https://www.mvig.org/index.html).
- Proposed a data-driven visual rhythm prediction method, in which several visual features are integrated by an end-to-end neural network to predict the visual onsets in a sequence labeling manner.

QA4IE+: A Real-Time Document Level Information Extraction System
- L. Qiu, D. Ru, Y. Xiao, **Y. Xie**, Q. Long, W. Zhang, K. Tu, Y. Yu
- Submitted to AAAI 2019.
- Aimed at implementing a system which can extract structured information from unstructured texts.
- The framework has been designed as a 4-stage pipeline which first recognizes named entity in articles and selects related relations from a knowledge base, then extracts information with a question answering system, and finally generates reliable tuples by named entity linking.

# Highlighted Projects
