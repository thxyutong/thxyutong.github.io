I am Yutong Xie (谢雨桐), a senior undergraduate student majoring in **Computer Science** at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](http://en.sjtu.edu.cn/).

Currently I am a visiting student at the University of Michigan, working with [Prof. Qiaozhu Mei](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~qmei/).

I am planning to apply for Ph.D. programs in Computer Science that start in Fall 2020, and here is my [curriculum vitae](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yutxie/yutxie.github.io/master/files/YutongXie.pdf).

----------------------------

# Education

[**Shanghai Jiao Tong University**](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/), *Sep. 2016 - Jun. 2020 (expected)*

- B.Sc. in Computer Science, with major GPA 92/100 (third year GPA 94/100).
- Member of [**ACM Honors Class**](https://acm.sjtu.edu.cn/), an elite CS program for top 5% talented students.
- Member of [**Zhiyuan Honors Program**](https://zhiyuan.sjtu.edu.cn/), a pilot program for training outstanding students in the basic sciences.

# Research Interests

My reserch interests lie in machine learning methods for both explicitly and implicitly structured data, e.g. **graph representation learning**, **natural language understanding**; and I’m also attracted by general machine learning problems, e.g. **multi-task learning**, **transfer learning**.
