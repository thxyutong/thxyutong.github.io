# Research Interests

My research interests lie in in structural representation learning, e.g. **graph representation learning**, **natural language understanding (NLU)**; and I'm also attracted by general machinelearning problems,  e.g. **multi-task learning (MTL)**, **transfer learning (TL)**, **learning to learn (LRL)**.

# Publications

Visual Rhythm Prediction with Feature-Aligned Network
- **Y. Xie**, H. Wang, Y. Hao, Z. Xu
- Proceedings of [the 16th IAPR International Conference on Machine Vision Applications Conference (MVA 2019)](http://www.mva-org.jp/Proceedings/2019/).
- Course project of [Computer Vision](http://www.mvig.org/teaching/index.html), advised by [Prof. Cewu Lu](https://www.mvig.org/index.html).
- Proposed a data-driven visual rhythm prediction method, in which several visual features are considered (including frames and residuals, optical flow, scene change, body pose) and integrated by an end-to-end neural network to predict the visual onsets in a sequence labeling manner.
- Observed the mis-aligning phenomenon in feature streams, and elaborately designed a feature aligning layer to alleviate this problem.

QA4IE+: A Real-Time Document Level Information Extraction System
- L. Qiu, D. Ru, Y. Xiao, **Y. Xie**, Q. Long, W. Zhang, K. Tu, Y. Yu
- Submitted to AAAI 2019.
- Aimed at implementing a system which can extract structured information from unstructured texts.
- The framework has been designed as a 4-stage pipeline which first recognizes named entity in articles and selects related relations from a knowledge base, then extracts information with a question answering system, and finally generates reliable tuples by named entity linking.
